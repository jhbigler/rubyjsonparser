# Pure Ruby JSON Parser

I wrote this strictly for funsies and to better learn and understand parsing concepts. There is zero reason to actually use this

## Test

`ruby test.rb <FILENAME>`

## Notes

- Can't guarantee complete correctness, especially with exponents (This shouldn't actually be used anyways)
- Probably inefficient, especially with the string parsing
